## User
I want to build job-recommendation-platform. Can you help me set up the project with JavaScript / Node?

## Assistant
Sure. Create a new project with `npm init -y`, then install the main dependencies (e.g. JavaScript, Node). Add a `src` folder and an entry point. I can give you exact commands and file contents next.

## User
Give me the exact npm install commands and a basic folder structure.

## Assistant
Run: `npm install JavaScript Node`. Create `src/index.js` (or `src/main.tsx` if using React/TS), `public/index.html` if needed, and a `package.json` script `"start": "node src/index.js"` or the appropriate dev server. Want me to paste a minimal `src/index.js` and `package.json`?

## User
Yes, paste a minimal working setup.

## Assistant
Here's a minimal setup. `package.json`: `"main": "src/index.js", "scripts": { "start": "node src/index.js" }`. `src/index.js`: `console.log('Hello');` and optionally a simple HTTP server with the framework you chose. Run `npm start` to verify.

## User
Now I need a landing page with a header and a CTA button.

## Assistant
Add a component (or HTML file) with a semantic `<header>`, a title, and a `<button>` or `<a>` for the CTA. Style with CSS or Tailwind. For React: create `Landing.jsx`, export it, and render it in your root. I can write the exact JSX/HTML if you tell me the button text and link.

## User
Button should say 'Get started' and link to /signup.

## Assistant
Use `<a href="/signup" className="...">Get started</a>` or `<Link to="/signup">Get started</Link>` if using React Router. Add the route for `/signup` in your router config so the link works.

## User
I'm getting a 404 on /signup. I have a Signup component.

## Assistant
Ensure your router has a route for `/signup` that renders the Signup component (e.g. `<Route path="/signup" element={<Signup />} />`). If you're not using a SPA router, the server must serve the signup page for that path. Check that the route is mounted and the path matches exactly.

## User
Can we add form validation for the signup form?

## Assistant
Add client-side validation: required fields, email format, password length. You can use native HTML5 (`required`, `type="email"`, `pattern`) or a library (e.g. react-hook-form, zod). Show inline error messages and disable submit until valid. Optionally add server-side validation too.

## User
Let's add a simple API route that saves the user to the DB.

## Assistant
Create a POST route (e.g. `/api/signup`) that reads the body, validates input, hashes the password (e.g. bcrypt), and inserts a document into your DB (e.g. MongoDB). Return 201 with user id or 400 for validation errors. Use environment variables for the DB connection string.

## User
What's the best way to store the DB connection?

## Assistant
Use a single module that reads `process.env.MONGODB_URI` (or similar) and exports a connected client or mongoose connection. Create the connection once at startup and reuse it in routes. Never commit the URI; use `.env` and add it to `.gitignore`.

## User
I want to add a dashboard page that shows after login.

## Assistant
Add a protected route that checks for a logged-in user (e.g. JWT in cookie or header). If not authenticated, redirect to login. Render the dashboard component with a layout (sidebar, header) and placeholder content. We can add real data fetching next.

## User
How do I fetch the current user's profile on the dashboard?

## Assistant
From the frontend, send a request to e.g. `GET /api/me` with the auth token (cookie or Authorization header). The server validates the token and returns the user document (excluding password). Store in state or React Query and render in the dashboard.

## User
Can we add error handling so failed requests show a toast?

## Assistant
Use a toast library (e.g. react-hot-toast) or a simple context that holds error messages. In your API client or fetch wrapper, on non-ok response set the error and trigger the toast. Clear the toast after a few seconds or on dismiss.

## User
Let's add a logout button that clears the session.

## Assistant
On the client, clear the auth token (remove cookie or localStorage) and redirect to the login page. Optionally call a `POST /api/logout` that invalidates the server-side session if you use one. Reset any user state in your app.

## User
I'd like to run the app in Docker for local dev.

## Assistant
Create a `Dockerfile` that copies the app, runs `npm install`, and `npm start` (or `npm run build` and serve). Use a `.dockerignore` to exclude `node_modules`. For full stack, use docker-compose with a service for the app and one for the DB, with the app depending on the DB.

## User
Should we add tests?

## Assistant
Yes. Add a test runner (Jest or Vitest) and write unit tests for utilities and API handlers (e.g. supertest for HTTP). For the frontend, consider React Testing Library. Aim for critical paths: auth, signup, and one main feature. Run tests in CI.

## User
One more thing: add a README with setup and run instructions.

## Assistant
In the README include: project name, short description, prerequisites (Node version), `npm install`, how to set `.env` (list vars without values), `npm start` and `npm test`. Optionally add a screenshot and link to the live app.
